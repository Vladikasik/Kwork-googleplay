This route generator attempts to find an optimal route through global airways and intersections. When crossing the Atlantic or the Pacific, the current oceanic tracks can optionally also be considered. Generation can take up to 2 minutes, so please be patient in Flight Planner.\nDisclaimer\nUnder no circumstances should any of the plans or data listed on this site be used for real-world aviation or as a substitute for proper flight planning.
