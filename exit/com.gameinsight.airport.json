    "description": "Airport games are a true adventure, and Airport City is among the best! It is much more than your average city simulator or one of the tycoon games. It takes the best of two worlds in just the right proportions: the sense of adventure from airplane games, and the need to plan strategically from the city simulators. If you\u2019re starting to think that there are things beyond farming, put your farm sim on hold and start building your town that will gradually become a city, and then a megapolis with the best airport in the world! We know how plane games can become repetitive over time, so we are constantly improving this city simulator, to ensure that our players are always engaged, both on the ground and in the air.\nWhether you want to try out the role of an air tycoon or an airline commander, you\u2019ll find something to love about Airport City.\nBuild a modern international-class terminal to send an airplane to whichever corner of the world you want. Just get your aircraft in the air and land them in any destination, from a faraway town to a shining megapolis. To make your travels memorable, you can bring back rare artifacts and unique collections. See how many souvenirs can fit in one aircraft!\nBut it\u2019s not just a flight simulator\u2014you\u2019ll have to apply your outstanding management skills to develop all the supporting infrastructure too, in one of the most amazing airport games!
