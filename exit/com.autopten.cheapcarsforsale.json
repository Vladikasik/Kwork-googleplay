If you\u2019re searching for used cars in \"like-new\" condition for $5000 or less and 1-3 years old, this isn\u2019t the app to find them.\nApp's purpose is helping users to find used cars from $500 up to $5000, which is our range for cheap cars, but please, keep in mind that some cars at these prices may need some work, have normal wear or high mileage, even though, we can assure that, according to their sellers, many of them run well and for some that\u2019s enough.\nAlso, although app encourages sellers to post cars for sale on this price range, it isn't mandatory or forced. Keep also in mind that CHEAP is an ambiguous/subjective word that relies on the budget and overall condition of the car, having the last word, a personal test drive, and inspection, things that APP hasn\u2019t a way to do by itself.\nAPP requests to sellers to post as much as they can detailed information about the overall condition of cars so buyers may have an idea if it worth the price or not, but again, a personal test drive will have the last word. Never pay money for a car you haven\u2019t tested/checked by yourself first. You can also always contact the seller to request more information which is the correct way to start the negotiation.\nLow inventory\n.  APP isn\u2019t a Silicon Valley-funded and service is totally FREE, so the budget to market it across the country is limited. Some users complain about the low inventory and we understand and apologize about it, so please, give it some time, we're trying as much as we can to make it known and discoverable. APP doesn\u2019t use automatic data feeds provided by street dealerships and their marketing networks which is the way bigger car finder apps work to provide millions of listings. Cheap Cars Finder APP relies more on used cars posted by their owners, at lower or cheaper prices that dealers may not be able to offer.\nJust give it a try, if you find something you like it, awesome! but if you don\u2019t, you can try another site/APP, that\u2019s how searching online works.
